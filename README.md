Paddle movement is controlled by z/s and up/down

The ball angle is manually controlled by a/e

The ball shader is not working

The ball/paddle collision is not working, the ball do not bounce back, instead its vertical movement get limited by the height of the paddle for about a third of the screen

Due to the previous issue, the scoring/game end is not implemented
